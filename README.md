## Hi there, I'm Thanh. As a Business Analyst, I apply my MS in Business Analytics and my 4+ years of accounting and financial analysis experience to help organizations make data-informed decisions and optimize their performance. I have a strong background in data analysis, data visualization, and data modeling, using tools such as Microsoft Power Query, Excel, and Tableau.

I have worked with various clients across different industries, including agriculture, biotechnology, and digital media, to provide insights and solutions for their business challenges. Some of my achievements include improving the budgeting and forecasting process for DOLE Fresh Vegetables, automating the revenue recognition and reporting for Technical Safety Services, and enhancing the customer segmentation and retention strategy for Y Media Labs. I am passionate about finding patterns and trends in data, and translating them into actionable recommendations that drive value and growth.
